************ USER MANUAL **************

    Everything is finished except for correctly 
    executing I/O redirection and piping, although
    as shown in the code, I attempted to solve these extensively.
    See my Word doc README for more detail.

    ABOUT myshell: this shell allows the user to enter some
    basic internal as well as external commands to gain information 
    about the computer's system. It also allows the user 
    to execute processes in the background and execute batch files.
    Executing a process in the background is creating another process
    which is essentially a copy of the current one and then not waiting
    for that process to finish before continuing back to myshell.
    Executing a batchfile just means instead of the user typing commands
    in, the commands are read line by line from a text file and then
    executed on.


    There are eight internal commands:
        1.) "cd" dirName - will change directory into dirName,
                           or if you just type "cd", will to the 
                           system's home directory.
        2.) "help" - will print out this user manual, or if you type
                    "help commandName", it will print 
                    some info about that commandName.
        3.) "clear" - will clear the shell's screen.
        4.) "dir" - will print the contents of the current directory,
                    this includes files and other directories within it.
        5.) "env" - will print out the system's environment variables.
        6.) "echo" - will print to the screen what you type after it,
                     for example 'echo sometext' will 
                     print 'sometext' to the screen.
        7.) "pause" - will pause the execution of the shell until
                      Enter is pressed.
        8.) "quit" - will exit the shell entirely.

    There are a variety of external commands:
        Your system contains a variety of commands to execute in your
        regular shell. These commands include 'ls, pwd, mkdir, rm, cat'
        among many other commands. By typing 'ls' for example you'll 
        see it prints the contents of the current directory you are cd'ed 
        into. (Note: the dir internal command also accomplishes this)
        You'll find you are also able to execute these commands within 
        myshell. Give it a shot! :)

    To execute a program in the background:
        Within myshell, type './myshell &' to execute yet another myshell in 
        the background of the currently executing one. You can see a list of
        currently running processes by typing 'ps -a'. There you can see two
        instances of myshell executing.
    
    To execute a program with a batchfile: 
        When going to execute myshell, type './myshell input.txt' to execute
        myshell with the commands given in input.txt. Notice that the output for 
        these commands is printed to screen, despite them not being typed in and
        executed by the user. These commands are read from the batchfile input.txt
        and then executed on.
